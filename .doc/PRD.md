## 3. Submit YouTube/Podcast Link & Generate Summary

- After creating an account, users should be able to submit a YouTube link (which could be of multiple types)
- We validate the youtube link immediately on the client side
- User can click on 'Generate Summary' button to generate the summary
- We show a skeleton loader of Summary Card on button click
- We show the summary card with the summary on success
- The system should generate a summary and relevant tags for that particular video
- On the summary card, the user should see:
  - **The name/title** of the video or podcast. (clicking on this should open the video/podcast in a new tab)
  - **The channel name**. (clicking on this should open the channel page in a new tab)
  - **The creation date** of the video or podcast.
  - **Subscribe** button, which allows the user to subscribe to the channel.
  - **Tags generated for that summary/content.** [tags will be same for a summary/video - essentially link tags to a content piece and not the summary]
  - **Names of the people who are featured in the video/podcast**
- The content should be well formatted and easy to read.
- If the summary for a video has already been generated, display the existing summary to save on API/LLM costs. [same for transcript. if for a content piece we already have content pulled in, we should not pull it again. retreiving the same summary will also result in a much faster experience. also, will have to do a lot of prompt engineering to improve the quality of the summary to get names, tags, main points, examples mentioned properly]

## 5. Interactive Q&A with Transcript

- After reading a summary, users should be able to **chat** with the video or podcast, asking very specific questions.
- An **integrated LLM** should provide answers based on the content of the transcript.
- User should be able to ask question on the summary card itself. Once the question is asked, we should show a chat interface on a separate new page (QnA page) with the question and the answer. Video name should be at the top of the page with chanel name.
- The QnA should be only on the transcript of the video
- User should be able to ask follow up questions. [ensure context for followup questions is transcript + previous question and answer]

## 6. Tags Functionality

- Each **summary card** should display **tags extracted** from the video or podcast.

## 7. Automated Content Updates & Notifications

- A **cron job** should periodically check for **new videos or podcasts** in all channels on the platform.
- Users should receive a **daily email** listing new content summaries from their subscribed channels.
- If **there is no new content** for a user on a given day, **no email** should be sent.

## 8. Channel Discovery & Ranking

- Channels with most subscribers on our platform should be shown at the top of the discover channels page

## 9. Content Details

- When a user posts a URL, we show the summary that was generated for that content even if the summary was not generated by the same user.
- For every URL or video/podcast, all the details of the content that we show on the summary card should be stored in the database. Following are the details that we store:
  - Title
  - Channel Name
  - Creation Date
  - Transcript
  - Summary
  - Tags
  - Names of the people featured in the summary

## 10. Edge Cases
